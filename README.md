# Performance evaluation of Terapixel rendering in Cloud (Super)computing

Welcome to my Project

To load this project, you'll first need to `setwd()` into the directory
where this README file is located. Then you need to run the following two
lines of R code:

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()

After you enter the second line of code, you'll see a series of automated
messages as ProjectTemplate goes about doing its work. This work involves:
* Reading in the global configuration file contained in `config`.
* Loading any R packages you listed in the configuration file.
* Reading in any datasets stored in `data` or `cache`.
* Preprocessing your data using the files in the `munge` directory.

Once that's done, you can execute any code you'd like. You'll have access to
all of your data, already fully preprocessed, and all of the libraries you 
want to use.

To run the analysis you can go into the `/src` folder and choose the file you
would like to explore. To see a complete report of the work that was done, 
you can go into the `/report` folder and in there you will find PDF file with
all the work that I did.
